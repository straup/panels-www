        <h3>panels</h3>

<p><code>panels</code> is a simple web-based sketching application built on top
  of Ian Li's <a href="http://ianli.com/sketchpad/">Raphael SketchPad</a> and Mozilla's
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/localforage">localforage</a> library.</p>

<p>Sketches can be saved to (and re-loaded (and deleted) from) the browser's
  local storage database.</p>

<p>Raphael SketchPad exposes a number of "canvas" and "pen" related options. None
of them are available in <code>panels</code>. They might be one day but for now the easiest
way to think about things is being like sketching with a pen. The default settings for the "pen" are 1-pixel wide with an opacity of 60 percent. There is no undo.</p>

<p><code>panels</code>
  uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">Scalable
  Vector Graphics (SVG)</a> under
  the hood so all of your sketches can
  be <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/1539#id764105">view source</a>-ed allowing them to be exported as a set of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=sol%20lewitt%20from%3Athisisaaronland">drawing instructions</a>, in
  plain text. This
  is one of those things that never seems very important until it is (at which
  point it's usually too late) so there's a
  handy button for doing just that on every sketch.</p>

<h3>Is there a demo?</h3>

<p><a href="demo">Yes!</a></p>

<h3>How do I set up my own instance of panels?</h3>

<p>Unless you are interested in uploading sketches to a remote server <code>panels</code> has
no server-side dependencies and can be run as-is in any old (modern-ish) web
browser. The only thing you'll need to do is copy the <code>www/index.html.example</code> file to
<code>www/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>The reason you need to do this is because <code>www/index.html</code> is
explicitly forbidden from being included in source control. That might seen a
bit strange for a web-application but is necessary because it prevents any
custom changes that a person makes to enable uploads (which are configured in the <code>index.html</code> file) from
being applied to everyone else's stuff.</p>

<h3>How do I configure panels to upload files?</h3>

<p>Configuring <code>panels</code> to upload sketches to a remote server is
  outside the scope of this document. Please
  consult <a href="https://github.com/straup/panels-www#uploading-files">the
  main Github repository</a> for details.</p>
